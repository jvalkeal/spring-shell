NOTE: Feature is experimental and subject to breaking changes until foundation
      and related concepts around framework are getting more stable.

_Terminal UI Framework_ is a toolkit to build rich console apps. This section is
for those using existing features as is. If you're planning to go deeper possibly
creating your own components <<appendix-tech-intro-tui>> provides more detailed
documentation.

TIP: Catalog sample is a good place to study a real application <<appendix-tui-catalog>>.
