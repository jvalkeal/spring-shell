=== Native Support

Re-work with _2.1.x_ brings in an experimental support for compiling shell application
into _native_ application with _GraalVM_ and _spring-native_. As underlying _jline_
library works with _GraalVM_ most of a things should just work.

Project can be compiled with native profile to get sample compiled as an native
application:

====
----
$ ./mvnw clean package -Pnative
----
====

You can then run sample either with interactive or non-interactive mode:

====
----
$ ./spring-shell-samples/target/spring-shell-samples help
