== Introduction

=== What is Spring Shell?
Not all applications need a fancy web user interface!
Sometimes, interacting with an application through an interactive terminal is
the most appropriate way to get things done.

Spring Shell lets you create such a runnable application, where the
user enters textual commands that are run until the program terminates.
The Spring Shell project provides the infrastructure to create such a REPL (Read, Eval,
Print Loop), letting you concentrate on the commands implementation by using
the familiar Spring programming model.

Advanced features such as parsing, tab completion, colorization of output, fancy ascii-art
table display, input conversion, and validation are all include, freeing you
to focus on core command logic.
