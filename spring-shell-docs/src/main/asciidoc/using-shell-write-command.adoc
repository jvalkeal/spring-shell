=== Writing Your Own Commands

The way Spring Shell decides to turn a method into an actual shell command is entirely pluggable
(see <<extending-spring-shell>>). However, as of Spring Shell 2.x, the recommended way to write commands
is to use the new API described in this section (the standard API).

When you use the standard API, methods on beans are turned into executable commands, provided that:

* The bean class bears the `@ShellComponent` annotation. This is used to restrict the set of beans that
are considered.
* The method bears the `@ShellMethod` annotation.

[TIP]
====
The `@ShellComponent` is a stereotype annotation that is itself meta-annotated with `@Component`. As a result,
you can used it in addition to the filtering mechanism to declare beans (for example, by using `@ComponentScan`).

You can customize the name of the created bean by using the `value` attribute of the annotation.

==== Documenting the Command

The only required attribute of the `@ShellMethod` annotation is its `value` attribute, which should have
a short, one-sentence, description of what the command does. This lets your users
get consistent help about your commands without having to leave the shell (see <<help-command>>).

NOTE: The description of your command should be short -- no more than one or two sentences. For better
consistency, it should starts with a capital letter and end with a period.

==== Customizing the Command Name(s)

By default, there is no need to specify the key for your command (that is, the word(s) that should be used
to invoke it in the shell). The name of the method is used as the command key, turning camelCase names into
dashed, gnu-style, names (that is, `sayHello()` becomes `say-hello`).

You can, however, explicitly set the command key, by using the `key` attribute of the annotation:

====
[source, java]
----
	@ShellMethod(value = "Add numbers.", key = "sum")
	public int add(int a, int b) {
		return a + b;
	}

----
====

NOTE: The `key` attribute accepts multiple values.
If you set multiple keys for a single method, the command is registered with those different aliases.

TIP: The command key can contain pretty much any character, including spaces. When coming up with names though,
keep in mind that consistency is often appreciated by users (that is, you should avoid mixing dashed-names with
spaced names and other inconsistencies).
