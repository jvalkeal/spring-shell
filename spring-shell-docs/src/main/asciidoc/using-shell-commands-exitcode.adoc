==== Exit Code
ifndef::snippets[:snippets: ../../test/java/org/springframework/shell/docs]

Many command line applications when applicable return an _exit code_ which running environment
can use to differentiate if command has been executed successfully or not. In a `spring-shell`
this mostly relates when a command is run on a non-interactive mode meaning one command
is always executed once with an instance of a `spring-shell`.

Default behaviour of an exit codes is as:

- Errors from a command option parsing will result code of `2`
- Any generic error will result result code of `1`
- Obviously in any other case result code is `0`

Every `CommandRegistration` can define its own mappings between _Exception_ and _exit code_.
Essentially we're bound to functionality in `Spring Boot` regarding _exit code_ and simply
integrate into that.

Assuming there is an exception show below which would be thrown from a command:

It is possible to define a mapping function between `Throwable` and exit code. You can also
just configure a _class_ to _exit code_ which is just a syntactic sugar within configurations.
