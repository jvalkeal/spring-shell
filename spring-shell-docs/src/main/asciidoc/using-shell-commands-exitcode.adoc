==== Exit Code
Many command line applications when applicable return an _exit code_ which running environment
can use to differentiate if command has been executed successfully or not. In a `spring-shell`
this mostly relates when a command is run on a non-interactive mode meaning one command
is always executed once with an instance of a `spring-shell`.

Default behaviour of an exit codes is as:

- Errors from a command option parsing will result code of `2`
- Any generic error will result result code of `1`
- Obviously in any other case result code is `0`

Every `CommandRegistration` can define its own mappings for from an _Exception_ into an
_exit code_.
