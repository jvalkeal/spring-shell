Testing cli application is difficult due to various reasons:

- There are differences between OS's.
- Within OS there may be different shell implementations in use.
- What goes into a shell and comes out from a shell my be totally
  different what you see in shell itself due to control characters.
- Shell may feel syncronous but most likely it is not meaning when
  someting is written into it, you can't assume next update in
  in it is not final.

NOTE: Testing support is currently under development and will be
      unstable for various parts.
