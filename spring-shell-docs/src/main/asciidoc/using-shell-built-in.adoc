[[built-in-commands]]
=== Built-In Commands

Any application built by using the `{starter-artifactId}` artifact
(or, to be more precise, the `spring-shell-standard-commands` dependency) comes with a set of built-in commands.
You can override or disable these commands individually (see <<overriding-or-disabling-built-in-commands>>).
However, if they are not overridden or disabled, this section describes their behavior.

[[help-command]]
==== Help

Running a shell application often implies that the user is in a graphically limited
environment. Also, while we are nearly always connected in the era of mobile phones,
accessing a web browser or any other rich UI application (such as a PDF viewer) may not always
be possible. This is why it is important that the shell commands are correctly self documented, and this is where the `help`
command comes in.

Typing `help` + `ENTER` lists all the commands known to the shell (including <<dynamic-command-availability,unavailable>> commands)
and a short description of what they do, similar to the following:

====
[source]
----
shell:>help
AVAILABLE COMMANDS
        add: Add numbers together.
      * authenticate: Authenticate with the system.
      * blow-up: Blow Everything up.
        clear: Clear the shell screen.
        connect: Connect to the system
        disconnect: Disconnect from the system.
        exit, quit: Exit the shell.
        help: Display help about available commands.
        register module: Register a new module.
        script: Read and execute commands from a file.
        stacktrace: Display the full stacktrace of the last error.

Commands marked with (*) are currently unavailable.
Type `help <command>` to learn more.
----
====

Typing `help <command>` shows more detailed information about a command, including the available parameters, their
type, whether they are mandatory or not, and other details.

The follwoing listing shows the `help` command applied to itself:

====
----
shell:>help help


NAME
	help - Display help about available commands.

SYNOPSYS
	help [[-C] string]

OPTIONS
	-C or --command  string
		The command to obtain help for.  [Optional, default = <none>]
----
====

==== Clear
The `clear` command does what you would expect and clears the screen, resetting the prompt
in the top left corner.

==== Exit

The `quit` command (also aliased as `exit`) requests the shell to quit, gracefully
closing the Spring application context. If not overridden, a JLine `History` bean writes a history of all
commands to disk, so that they are available again (see <<interacting-with-the-shell>>) on the next launch.

==== Stacktrace

When an exception occurs inside command code, it is caught by the shell and a simple, one-line message is displayed
so as not to overflow the user with too much information.
There are cases though when understanding what exactly happened is important (especially if the exception has a nested cause).

To this end, Spring Shell remembers the last exception that occurred, and the user can later use the `stacktrace`
command to print all the details on the console.

[[script-command]]
==== Script

The `script` command accepts a local file as an argument and replays commands found there, one at a time.

Reading from the file behaves exactly like inside the interactive shell, so lines starting with `//` are considered
to be comments and are ignored, while lines ending with `\` trigger line continuation.

==== History

The `history` command shows history of a commands which has been executed.

==== Completion

The `completion` command set allows you to create _scripts_ files which can be used
with am OS shell implementations to provide completion. This is very usefull when
working with non-interactive mode.

Currently only implementation is for _bash_ which works with `bash` sub-command.

==== Version

The `version` command shows existing _build_ and _git_ info by integrating into
Boot's `BuildProperties` and `GitProperties` if those exists in a shell app.
On default only version info is shown and other can be enabled via configuration
options.

Settings are under `spring.shell.command.version` where you can use `enabled` to
disable command and optionally define your own template with `template`. Options
`show-build-artifact`, `show-build-group`, `show-build-name`, `show-build-time`,
`show-build-version`, `show-git-branch`, `show-git-commit-id`,
`show-git-short-commit-id` and `show-git-commit-time` can be used to control
fields in a default template.

Template default to `classpath:template/version-default.st` and you can define
your own, for example having:

====
[source]
----
<buildVersion>
----
====

Which would simply output something like:

====
[source]
----
X.X.X
----
====

Attributes added to default template rendering are `buildVersion`, `buildGroup`,
`buildGroup`, `buildName`, `buildTime`, `gitShortCommitId`, `gitCommitId`,
`gitBranch` and `gitCommitTime`.
