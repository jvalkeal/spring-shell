=== Basics
You are here to learn basics of a _spring shell_. Before going forward to define actual _commands_ and _options_
lets take this moment to go trough some fundamental concepts of a _spring shell_.

Essentially few things needs to happen before you have a working _spring shell_ app:

- Create a _spring boot_ application
- Define commands and its option
- Package an application
- Execute either interactively or non-interactively

You will get a full working _spring shell_ application without defining any user level commands
as some basic build-in commands are provided out of a box like `help` and `history`.
