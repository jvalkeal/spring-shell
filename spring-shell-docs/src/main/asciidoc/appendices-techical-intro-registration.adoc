=== Command Registration
ifndef::snippets[:snippets: ../../test/java/org/springframework/shell/docs]

Defining a command registation is a first step to introduce a structure of a commands and its options
and parameters. This is loosely decoupled what happens later like parsing command-line and executing
actual target code. Essentially it is a definition of an command API shown to a user.

==== Commands
tbd

==== Interaction Mode
Spring Shell has been designed to work on two modes one being interactive which essentially
is a `REPL` where you have an active shell instance throughout commands and secondly
non-interactive mode where commands are executed one by one from a command line.

Differentation between these modes are mostly around limitations what can be done
in each mode as for example it would not be feasible to show what was a previous stacktrace
of a command if shell is not alive anymore and generally things around information
if shell is alive or not.

Also being on an active `REPL` session may provide more info about what user has been
doing within an active session.

==== Options
Options can be defined as long and short where prefixing is `--` and `-` respectively.
