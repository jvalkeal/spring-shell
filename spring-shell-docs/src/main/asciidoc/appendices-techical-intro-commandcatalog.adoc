=== Command Catalog
`CommandCatalog` is an interface defining how command registrations exists in
a shell application. It is possible to dynamically register and de-register
commands which gives flexibility for a user cases where possible commands will
come and go depending on a states shell is at.

==== Command Resolver
`CommandResolver` is an interface you can implement and define as a bean to dynamically
resolve mappings from a command names to its `CommandRegistration` instances. Its use
case looks something like:

[IMPORTANT]
====
Current limitation of a `CommandResolver` is that it is used every time commands are resolved.
Thus it's adviced not to use it if command resolve call takes a long time as it would
make shell feel sluggish.

==== Command Catalog Customizer
`CommandCatalogCustomizer` is an interface which can be used to customize a `CommandCatalog`.
Its main use case is to modify catalog and within `spring-shell` _auto-configuration_ this
interface is used to register existing `CommandRegistration` beans into a catalog.
Its use case looks something like:

Create `CommandCatalogCustomizer` as a bean and `spring-shell` will handle rest.
