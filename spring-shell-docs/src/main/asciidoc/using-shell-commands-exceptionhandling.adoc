=== Exception Handling
ifndef::snippets[:snippets: ../../test/java/org/springframework/shell/docs]

Many command line applications when applicable return an _exit code_ which running environment
can use to differentiate if command has been executed successfully or not. In a `spring-shell`
this mostly relates when a command is run on a non-interactive mode meaning one command
is always executed once with an instance of a `spring-shell`.

==== Exception Resolving

Unhandled exceptions will bubble up into shell's `ResultHandlerService` and then eventually
handled by some instance of `ResultHandler`. Chain of `ExceptionResolver` implementations
can be used to resolve exceptions and gives you flexibility to return message to get written
into console together with exit code which are wrapped within `HandlingResult`.

`ExceptionResolver` implementations can be defined globally as beans or defined
per `CommandRegistration` if it's applicable only for a particular command itself.

Use you own exception types which can also be an instance of boot's `ExitCodeGenerator` if
you want to define exit code there.

NOTE: With annotation based configuration exception resolving can only be customised globally

==== Exit Code Mappings

Default behaviour of an exit codes is as:

- Errors from a command option parsing will result code of `2`
- Any generic error will result result code of `1`
- Obviously in any other case result code is `0`

Every `CommandRegistration` can define its own mappings between _Exception_ and _exit code_.
Essentially we're bound to functionality in `Spring Boot` regarding _exit code_ and simply
integrate into that.

Assuming there is an exception show below which would be thrown from a command:

It is possible to define a mapping function between `Throwable` and exit code. You can also
just configure a _class_ to _exit code_ which is just a syntactic sugar within configurations.
