Tree-sitter is a native parsing library used by neovim and github to parse various
languages providing services like syntax highlighting.

Spring Shell Treesitter modules contains a compiled native libraries for linux,
macos and windows to be used via JDK's Foreign Function and Memory API and thus
needs minimum of JDK version 22.

Not yet full build automation so some things here for reminder:

Generate java api and compile shared libs. These needs jextract and zig locally.
